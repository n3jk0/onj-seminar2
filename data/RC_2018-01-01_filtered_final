22	politics	I don't even like Trump or his policies, to be clear. But I also judge him by his actions, and so far this action (terminating a gentleman's agreement that never existed and was never enforceable in the first place) is largely a lateral move that doesn't change the present state of things either way.

787	politics	It isn't "wages..." that create debt.  What creates debt is Boehner.  And Ryan.   And Republicans who use our tax payer dollars for war spending and who have REFUSED to do anything like the GI Bill.  The GI Bill is how we beat Russia into space, how we beat Russia economically.  Causing students to go into debt is a disgrace.   If we can't learn to spend to benefit America but we want to "defend" against a power that Russia was, how do we do it?  Not with Republicans. Not their agenda.  It is a crime against America's future and Republicans, Ryan and Congress are completely at fault for this.

I don't care if you're Roy Moore, Bill Clinton, or Ted Bundy. Until the trial you are considered under the law to be innocent.   Or do you think Emmit Till got what was coming to him?  If you can't understand this very simple legal concept, you're not worth my time.

4776	politics	The fall might be a steeper than election night! Bahahahahahah Mueller is going to clear his name because obviously they don't have anything substantial or they'd rock him day 1. He is about to work with Dems, against the GOP's wishes, and figure out healthcare. That with his named being clear idk how Dems are going to survive in 2018. I guess bring up a comment in a van again?   The only "excited" president I have ever seen on tv was the last one:   Source:  CNN footage: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LHk8ToWgPCk   It's over, time to wrap things up and create a new movement! Trump is a moderate that believes in liberally social policies and conservative fiscal policies. So, I would probably start somewhere around there then make marijuana legal. Unfortunately, Trump will counter with making marijuana legal. That means 2024 baby!   One more for ya *deficit* means:  "A budget deficit is an indicator of financial health in which expenditures exceed revenue. The term budget deficit is most commonly used to refer to government spending rather than business or individual spending, but can be applied to all of these entities."  Notice that word expenditures. That is a fancy word in accounting but means assets. Meaning you have to spend money on "expenditures" to create a deficit. Cutting taxes is not increasing the deficit.   Happy New Year and good luck on your movement!
4782	nba	I'm biased but Billy Mac and Stu are the best announcers in the business
4937	nba	Not my implication. I'm saying we should weight the performances of other players as greater because of their lesser situations. While it does not detract from Tatum's performance the other rookies performances are certainly bolstered by the lack of star power or team cohesion or coaching ability. They're doing more or as much with less, they should be rewarded for it. 
4964	politics	Pretty sure Trump endorsed and campaigned for a child molester
4978	politics	The rest of the world hopes so, too.  Not that we can be complacent; I suspect the Russians are pulling this crap with many countries. Most likely China as well, but I suspect they're playing a longer game.

5238	nba	 Devin Booker is dropping 5Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£
5241	nba	Yea he'll get in. Won't be first ballot but the only players retired or active not in the hall of fame above him on [Brefs probability page](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leaders/hof_prob.html) are:  Kobe, Duncan, Lebron, Wade, Dirk, CP3, Kidd, Durant, Ray Allen, Pierce, Bosh, Dwight Howard, Nash, Melo, Curry, Westbrook, Vince, Larry Foust, Tony Parker, And Pau.  There's a large number of guys (maybe half?) below his probability who are in the hall.   
5243	politics	Why are Republicans obsessed with infantilizing anyone who disagrees with them? To me, it's indicative of their own lacking maturity, most of haven't heard "you're such a baby" insults since middle School, because that's the age when everyone is insecure about crossing the blurry lines of maturity, or in this case, never passing through them at all. It may also come from a place of inability to be questioned, along with an original hatred for anyone younger than them. Lastly, it may come from a sexual place. A desire to emasculate men by calling them 'baby, whiney, boy, little' ("little Marco" -Trump). Or a desire to do the same calling women 'little girl, little lady, little missy'. I can't imagine anyone who talks so derogatory about people they don't know, to be very well balanced, psychologically or cognitively.

5534	politics	The wikipedia article was updated over time, so you can go through the edit history and see the total change over time. Hillary started out with a commanding lead, which Obama chipped away at all the way up to the first primary.
5559	politics	It's not gonna net all of them. There's probably thousands of guys like Clark running around in small rural towns where people are afraid to stand up to them, or worse, nod along with their bullshit until it affects them directly. Look at Roy Moore, he was involved in the Alabama "justice" system for decades before he got outed. And it only happened because someone from outside Alabama started poking around.
5637	nba	And the Warriors too. We played them 3 times in a week and a half.

5836	nba	I‚Äôll play devil‚Äôs advocate here. So all of you are saying he choked in the playoffs, which yes he technically did in the last game. But at the same time he was the main reason they even made it to a game 6.   Let‚Äôs also look at this this way. His stats in the other games are dismissed because of his bad stats in the series deciding game. Let‚Äôs say Harden was trash in games 1-5 but clutch in game 6 (and the rockets advance). Would he been seen as a choker still? Dismiss 5 bad games for one good game to clinch the series?
6010	politics	Man they know a tidal wave is coming in 2018  
6100	politics	&gt; Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be observed (seen, heard, touched, smelled or sensed in any way). This is a fundamental concept studied in the field of developmental psychology, the subfield of psychology that addresses the development of young children's social and mental capacities. There is not yet scientific consensus on when the understanding of object permanence emerges in human development.  Done for the benefit of Trump or Trump supporters?

6499	politics	&gt; Christie had no grass roots support, he was the pick of the RNC establishment.

The vast majority of taxes should be collected at the local/city/county/state/federal not the federal level and distributed back to the state/county/city/local governments.  You want a train? Fine, raise your local taxes and pay for it.  You don't want a train? Fine, don't raise your local taxes.  Instead the vast majority goes to the feds and then handed back as pet projects with strings attached which is inefficient and pisses everyone off.

9107	politics	The right wing has always been against college.  The problem has been the political takeover of colleges in the last 20 years.  Before it was professors and people like that running colleges.  Now its politicians (a lot of republicans) getting in there and building expensive buildings, expensive stadiums, and expensive homes on campus for themselves to live in.  Meanwhile, the number of professors and pay for them has declined.  The price has gone up so much, and quality gone down, that it is no longer worth it for a lot of people.

My experience is that whenever a Republican claims they've got a bill to do something good, they've always got a clause in it to set up puppy murder farms or torch some orphanages or something equally unconscionable. That way when the Democrats vote against it they can say "See? Democrats want high taxes on the middle class! I am defeated! I guess I'll just stick with the puppy/orphan slaughter part of my agenda since I can't work with those obstructing Dems."

13021	politics	Here in Finland, any healthcare out of pocket costs are capped at ~600 ‚Ç¨ per year per person. And if a parent goes over that, all their (iirc must live in the same household) underage kids get a waiver for the year too. Or vice versa if one of the kids go over it, one of the parents gets a waiver. Basically it's max. 2*600‚Ç¨ per household I guess.  Oh and if you're getting the last ditch social security, *all* medical costs, including prescription meds, are covered.  (Generally the system pretty much the same as the NHS was described above; the system isn't working at it's peak any more these days, but critical, chronic, and urgent stuff is treated excellently and promptly; it's little nagging stuff and such that you may have to wait in line for at a clinic, or wait a while to get an appointment, if you don't have supplementary health insurance and/or don't want to pay for private doctors/hospitals)

If Republicans only had to spend the year selling this bill they might get a significant political victory here, but people are going to be pissed at their every fuck up and democrats will only need to point at all the bad parts of the bill to sour people towards the tax bill too.

16200	nba	Honestly, this is getting out of hand. Why does the NBA feel the need to do this? 
16288	politics	I agree with you in general.  But the purpose of blaming the voters is to get people to realize that we *do* have the power. We need to get out the vote, and we need to vote for the better candidate. If youth turnout was the same as elderly turnout, the government would look *vastly* different, and no amount of gerrymandering, voter suppression, or anything Republicans could try would stop them.  They can make it so that minorities, the working poor, and college students have a harder time voting than old rich white people. And that will certainly stop some of them. But it won't stop all of them. Most of them consciously make the decision to either stay home, or to not vote for the better candidate. And no, shame won't work. (I don't know what will. I'm not that bright.) But we need to acknowledge this problem. We can't ever fix Republicans being shitty. We can (theoretically) fix the voters.

I also wonder how he'd do if he had to face a team like GSW. If Lebron beats this iteration of GSW, he's GOAT for me no question. Lebron has been an underdog in most of his finals iirc (and will be this year if he makes it again) which is insane. He's faced some seriously historically great teams and for 2 of his finals he was very undermanned. The only one he should've won and didn't was 2011 and unfortunately some people never let that go. Was Jordan's team ever the underdog?

[In Feb 2013 her favorable ratings were 19 points higher than Joe Biden](https://www.washingtonpost.com/page/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2013/01/23/National-Politics/Polling/release_196.xml), and she even far outperformed [Obama and Biden](http://www.gallup.com/poll/162020/hillary-clinton-popular-obama-biden.aspx) at the time as well. She was IMMENSELY popular and liked only 3-years ago. Whats more, during her time as Senator, she was very popular as well.   She was swiftboated, 2004 John Kerry style. The republicans managed to take John Kerry, who honorably served in Vietnam and received multiple medals and commendations, and *successfully* made him out to be a trooper-hating piece of shit. This is what happened to Clinton. Benghazi, emails, all manufactured scandals designed to sow doubt into the minds of useful liberal idiots who were gullible, and energize their base.     And it wasn't like they didn't make their efforts and goals known: [GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to Sean Hannity (in interview, 2015): "Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/12/how-much-of-hillary-clintons-polling-decline-is-thanks-to-the-benghazi-committee/).   Prior to the 2012 election, Republicans blamed Obama for Benghazi, afterwards they pivoted to Clinton - clearly in preparation should she run.  Even then, her favorability ratings stayed in the 60's through a Senate Select Committee investigation, 5 House Commitee inquiries, and another Senate Committee investigation.  It took all the way until Boehner's House Select Committee to drag her favorabilities down into the upper 50's - closer to Obama's but still ahead of Biden's.  fyi - Thanks for the gold!

19809	politics	It is significant, I'm not arguing against that, a d like I've said before, it's definitely a step in the right direction.  However, people need to know that it's still technically illegal according to the feds to smoke anywhere in the US. And that using marijuana in places like California can still hurt you legally. This just emphasizes the fact that we need to be pressuring our federal representatives to get off their asses and finally reschedule the drug or actually pass legislation decriminalizing it at the federal level. Until then it's still  not tech technically legal.

20990	nba	The shot'll come, he seems like the kind of guy that practices a ton on his flaws.
21006	politics	You are correct in many ways. Thank you for the thoughtful response.  I agree that funding higher education needs to be a priority, the problem is that throwing more money at problems doesn't always fix them. I am more familiar with west coast Universities and I am troubled by the amenities war taking place on campus and RAPID replacement of local students with international ones. Throwing money is one way to solve this problem, one reason international students are increasingly popular is because they pay more in tuition allowing the university to subsidize local and disadvantaged students, but they take up those students places in the process and often take their skills (or degree without the skills) back to their home country. This is not good for America and I see no one willing to talk about except for a few. The college administration is bloated beyond belief and with ever increasing mandates to "protect" (see: coddle) their students they are sure to grow.   So in my opinion its not a lack of funds that higher ed is suffering from its lack of creativity and collaboration with industry. Of course it starts in local public schools which could undoubtably use more funding in most cases (not all). That is the money that should be spread around more, but it is a LOCAL problem not one for the federal government. Rich schools are using money frivolously that poorer communities desperately need especially in the places like CA and NY.  Also yes the GOP does have a shitty track record on the economy (looking at you Bush II), but at least Trump isn't very connected to the party of old. I have never liked Bush and find comfort in the fact that Trump hasn't either, also mentioned in a debate that 9/11 happened under Bush's watch which would have been the end of most republicans career.

24428	politics	So no red areas. 
24507	politics	If you're going to point to just one thing, it should be the Electoral College. The popular vote wasn't close.  But it's also because when a president from one party has been in office for eight years, people tend to elect one from the other. And because Hillary Clinton wasn't a candidate that a lot of people on the left could get excited about. And because, unfair as the email scandal may have been, the Clinton campaign flubbed their public relations response to it. And because, rightly or wrongly, the Clintons have been a magnet for scandal and spurious accusations for decades. And then there's Bernie Sanders, and there's Sarah Silverman at the Democratic National Convention telling idealistic and politically engaged young people to stop being 'ridiculous.'  There was a lot going on in 2016. The election came down to a few tens of thousands of votes in a few states, and a lot of things could potentially have shifted them one way or the other. Russian Propaganda was definitely a factor, but even that is dependent on other things.  Facebook could probably have turned the election just by changing their rules about who they sold ads to. But, if you recall, they'd just [gotten caught suppressing conservative news articles](https://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006). Maybe letting Russian fake news run wild was actually an over-correction, and they were trying to present the appearance of impartiality.  Anyway, it's oversimplifying things a lot to say it was just Russian propaganda alone. The Russians took advantage of existing weaknesses in our online culture, and they pushed at just the right tipping point, when American politics was already highly polarized. It was an opportunistic attack, and it worked, but its success was dependent on a lot of other existing conditions.

Again I can say 100% without any doubt because I know it as an absolute truth that not every edible sold in the state of CA is accurate to the % of THC in their edible.

27578	politics	A 3rd party has no chance at a higher office because they don't have the money and corporate donors. Democrats and Republicans are controlled opposition. 2 party duopoly will be in tact forever until we get rid of the money and corporate interest in politics. And the electoral college is the only way a 3rd party has a possibility of winning. And it's crucial we keep our Constitution in tact. The moment it starts getting eroded, it's a slippery slope. The mob should never rule.   And "universal healthcare, overbearing environmental regulations, etc." Is all about government control. They believe in the control of the people and their goods by a bigger federal government. Anything the government has their nose in is a mess. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. I don't support Democrat or Republican since 08 when I voted for Obama. The federal government overreach, or the clash concerning federal government control, will be the downfall of our country as we know it.   "The greatest tyrannies are always perpetuated in the name of the noblest causes."

28159	nba	&gt;Total chances are irrelevant when **Jordan effectively never did it**; either way, though, Lebron has won more underdog series per year, if that is your argument.  How many times would you say LeBron's teams won playoff series when they were the underdog? By my memory it was only twice: against the Pistons in 2007 and against the Warriors in 2015 (if I'm missing any, let me know).   Jordan's Bulls did it twice in the 89 playoffs, when they as the 47 win 6th seed in the East upset the 57 win Cavs in the 1st round and then upset the 52 win Knicks in the 2nd round before going on to lose to the eventual champion Pistons in 6 games in the ECF.  If you look at Jordan's entire playoff career (excluding the year he played baseball) the only teams to ever eliminate Jordan's Bulls were the Larry Bird Celtics and the Bad Boy Pistons, both multi-championship teams who were in their primes while Jordan was still young. Once Jordan was in his prime he never lost again. To me that's far more impressive than what LeBron has done in his playoff career, even though I still have LeBron as one of the best players ever.
28182	politics	On December 14, President Trump had two stacks of papers next to him, one of new regulations, and one of old, removed regulations. The stack of old removed regulations was exponentially larger than the new ones. For every new regulation, 22 were removed.   Walmart is bringing back thousands of reshored jobs from China.  Ford is bringing back thousands of reshored jobs from Mexico and Spain.  Same with Boeing and countless others. The reason they were in foreign countries was because they were freer to do what they wanted there, due to these regulations that Trump has removed in the past year.

28415	politics	Is it clear yet?  The debt doesn't come from under employment. The debt should never have existed to begin with.    It should be possible to pay for college without causing enormous debt and it was possible before.  I realize people today simply don't realize what it has meant for the US to have a very successful economy, for jobs to be plentiful.  It was not a "Democrat" or "Republican" thing since George H.W. Bush was instrumental in recovery from one of the Reagan administrations worst recessions.  What is necessary is a graduated tax structure.  Every time that Republicans have run their "tax cut for the rich" it has caused recession and that recession has actually hurt the rich as well as the poor.  Forcing our children into debt is a bad decision. And that decision won't go  away until Paul Ryan is no longer the speaker of the house.  This isn't a "Trump" problem except that he is the "signing arm" for Ryan and McConnell.   .
28561	nba	Same as Smart then.
28619	nba	Seems like a really interesting stat, I‚Äôd like to see it be used for an even larger sample size though. 
28708	politics	Well, I disagree wholeheartedly that they are unreachable but it's a matter of opinion not fact, although it think there is sufficient evidence with ex conservitives but that's neither here nor there.  The chances of removing their institutions of propaganda is a pipe dream so long as freedom of speech exists. It's never going to happen. If if it moved off air, they'd find space online, paper, radio and removing them would only fuel their psychotic conspiracy wing nuts which would further the extreme right agenda not hinder it. And BTW, iirc, fox News won a court case for intentionally reporting news they knew was untruthful and did so by claiming they are an entertainment agency, not a news agency. And the conservatives know it and don't give a single fuck because they see the courts and liberals as trying to suppress the truth and fox did what they had to so they could continue to report the "truth"   But let's say youre right for arguments sake, and we somehow get passed all their money and the politicians that depend on fox and their ilk. Let's says that measures are taken that force them to only report the factual truth, they are still allowed their interpretations of that truth which can do as much damage as a falsehood. But let's say that in some crazy way that even that was prohibited, they would still find a way. Any way in which you can propose stopping them from reporting bullshit, Im sure I can find a way to convince you on how they'd get around it.  We are not going to beat them by removing their propaganda, attacking those institutions will only serve to promote further right wing propaganda and those people will sink deeper into the intellectual bullshit.  The only way to get them passed it is through teaching people how to think critically, there is no other way.  As for your other thoughts, I agree whole heartedly. Trump, his administration and anyone else we can root out as having committed crimes against the people need to be dealt with. But  it won't stop the next in line leaders of the conservative right from stepping in and filling their shoes regardless if the dems control the administration and the houses. We have to address why people think they way they do, show them there's another way and continue to be vigilant in denouncing, or worse, those in the conservative party that would use the same tactics to take advantage of their stupidity and gullibility.   And just for the record, the dems are just as fucking bad. Trump is an exception of the conservative right and not the norm. The majority of the conservative party and the majority of the democratic party are elitist bastards that work in government to serve their own agendas which usually coincide with the capitalist pigs. At this point there isn't much difference between those in power of the government and those in power from capitalism.

28830	politics	Hey second place is first loser!
28927	politics	&gt; It's not irrelevant, and it's telling that people would rather just shuffle this under the rug rather than get simple questions. You want answers on whether Trump colluded with Russia, well, there are valid questions on the other side too.  You really don't get it. I'm happy for the details to emerge. The whole saga grows more fascinating as details come out. But they are irrelevant to big picture - as explained in my last post and more below.  &gt;And you mischaracterize the issue, it's not the act of sending the report to the FBI, but rather the FBI's use of the report to justify spying on the opposing political campaign. Think about that. Let it sink in. You don't have to answer/respond, but just dwell on how significant of a problem that is.  Your projection is showing.  Like I said, it is not a crime for the FBI to use a report to request a warrant from the FISA court. One must mischaracterize the whole situation to make it a crime. You have no evidence that the warrant was obtained for political reasons, yet you state it as fact to make up a spooky story, when in fact the FBI probe was instigated by communications from our Australian allies after a Trump coffee boy extraordinaire bragged about his Russia connections to a diplomat there.   &gt;We don't know anything frankly.  We know lots. We don't know all the details, but those are coming.  &gt;That's the latest NYT report, but come on, you can't take anything at face value.   Sure, I guess. Taken in a vacuum, a story about one of Trump's top foreign policy advisers drunkenly bragging about his part in the winning strategy to an Australian diplomat means very little on the surface. Sure. Okay, yeah.  &gt;That NYT report just gives more questions than answers.   Like what? What additional questions?   &gt;You could easily conclude that this NYT article is a means to gain distance from the dossier  The dossier was never the crux of the investigation. You have to - wait for it, it's coming, just a moment now - *mischaracterize* the Russia probe to make any sort of case that it ever was.   &gt;which is now under tremendous scrutiny in congress.  LOL! You mean the same people you brought you all our favorite smash hits, such as Benghazi?! Fast and Furious?! The IRS targeting of con non-profits even though 1) more liberal groups were "targeted" and 2) Congress wound up clearing the IRS of any wrongdoing?! LOLOLOLOKAY!  &gt;Not sure what your last point is so please clarify.  Sure. You said:  &gt;Why are we only learning about the Australian/Popadapolous meeting now - after Obama publicly said in Oct 2016 that the election could not be rigged?  to which I reply:  &gt;Infiltrating a campaign is not the same as rigging the election.  Again, I don't know if you're still hanging on to that one or not, but there it is.

29257	politics	Well, I'm not a fox viewer but for a long time now the capitalist industry has put a focus on only hiring people with a degree that earns owners a particular kind of profit (at the expense of other jobs). However even if you have a degree no company has any kind of an obligation to find you a job in any context. Getting a degree might make you look like a better worker but if you got a degree in art or math and you apply for a job at starbucks just to get some money to survive people will probably look at you funny and act like you're supposed to have found some high paying job with the fancy degree. Capitalism doesn't care if you were the best organic chemist in your class, there's a million other people who aced that class, and the owners of those companies are going to hire their family and friends before they consider someone with a degree, unless it's absolutely necessary to hire this person for their knowledge, then they'll hire them on contract basis.  People are nervous about college because no longer does a college degree mean you get a job. If anything, at times it seems like getting a college degree means that you'll be working as hard as your college years all your life struggling to be your own small business selling whatever little services capitalism wants from your degree, while the rest of you doesn't get fulfillment. Co-workers that always change, no benefits, complicated taxes. It's attempting to turn every citizen into a small business that just so happens to have a pulse. Me completing a college degree isn't going to change my relationship to industry, at times it just makes me easier to exploit.
29264	politics	Why does it matter what they get their degree in? It's supply and demand, if someone wants to pay to learn basket weaving and someone else is willing to take money to teach it, why should any of us care.  College isn't supposed to be job training, its just continuing education. Guidance counselors should certainly counsel young adults on the possible career paths for given degree programs, but why does it matter what someone studies?

30798	politics	I would argue that trying to view it from a point of logic isn't a very fruitful pursuit. I'm simply saying look at their actions.   Check out this article from NPR where they mention a study of the 2008 election that states that 25% of Hillary Clinton primary voters voted for John McCain in the general election.  Which while it is disappointing, shouldn't be a shock. I don't know how closely you followed the 2008 primary, but Clinton had a fair number of supporters who vowed they would never vote for Obama.  That's how close, hard fought primaries can go. But we need to be better than that.   I can't imagine how someone who was butthurt over Bernie's loss could possibly defend not voting for Clinton in the general election after nearly a year of Trump in office. You just can't take someone like that seriously.  Edit: Forgot to include a link to the NPR article. https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds

30885	nba	"Horrid" is a hyperbolic word.  The truly horrid 3 shooters mostly don't take them.  If Marcus Smart is horrid at 3s, how do we describe Ben Simmons, who has made a grand total of one in college and NBA combined?  29.4% on threes is the equivalent of 44% on twos.  Allen Iverson shot 31.3% on nearly 4 three attempts per game.  This was more than enough to cause defenses to at least pay attention to it, which helped open up space, etc.  Marcus Smart's ability to shoot 29% threes instead of 12% matters to his team and career, and it would help Ben Simmons if he could do the same, but for whatever reason, many people only look at it in black or white.

Both will have great legacies, but the KD-Warriors era will cement his long term legacy as one of the greats because of numbers + team legacy. I don't even like KD, just calling it as it is.

31377	politics	I honestly don't understand though, if the government says you have to pay X tax, you only pay X. If that number goes up or down you pay it. Is that not what you do? If Trump gave you a tax cut what do you do, overpay on your taxes to make up the amount?   What you probably didn't know is that the self employed and many small businesses pay a tax rate much higher then regular employees do. It's like a punishment for being an entrepreneur. This at least brings it closer to the tax rate I would pay if I were back working for a regular employer.   How is my paying the current tax rate hurting others? By that metric we shouldn't use electricity, own electronics, drive cars etc because all of those things hurt others.

32516	politics	Notice the word Revenue.  Cutting revenue increases the deficit.  Republicans know this because they set the tax cuts to expire to get around rules that state they can't increase the deficit after a 10 year window.  Also, there is nothing socially liberal about Trump.  Not on the environment, not on police brutality, not on abortion.  We heard that before the election and every appointment he has made has shown that to be bullshit.  He has so poisoned the well that there is no incentive for Democrats to cooperate with him on anything.

34390	politics	&gt; Notice the phrase "designated forum." Universities have to give space for speech, but they have a say in which space.  &gt; You can't interrupt a Bio lecture with your speech.  Right winger here - I agree with you on this, as long as the university provides access to the same venues, provided they follow the same procedures for scheduling the event, and doesn't, for example, allow a left-leaning speaker to use a huge auditorium while relegating conservative speakers to the mop closet.  At public universities of course.  Private universities can allow or disallow whatever speakers they want, but I think that part of a well-rounded education is being exposed to a variety of viewpoints and ideas, and that failure to do this is to the detriment of it's students.

Ask them if they think weekends off, 40 hour work week, workmans comp, job safety is fair.  There are many more progressive things the right takes for granted as being an American norm.

35825	politics	To be clear: there is a difference in opposing higher education, and understanding that universities are constantly increasing tuition and student debt while the returns to investment on many degrees are stagnating (due to overall wage stagnation) and a college degree is no longer a guarantee of a great career. Although degree earners have significant lifetime income gains over non-degree earners, the prospect of an average of $33k in student loan debt is enough to cause some to lose faith in degrees over trades.

37326	nba	If Westbrook moved this much off the ball, KD wouldn't have left OKC and the Thunder would be the one or two seed, depending on whether or not they have Horford lol.   Edit: Also, if WB was moving this much off ball, you'd hope KD would do the same too, as a young player. You can still see Durant's OKC habits come out, because he doesn't move off the ball nearly as much as Klay or Steph do. He likes to camp out on the wing and kinda call for the ball if he's open.   You do see him move around and come off screens to get good post position, but that often ends up being an iso for KD. He's gotten better at finding cutters lately though - particularly Bell and Casspi just sitting under the basket with no defender on them.  I wonder how much Scott Brooks is at fault for WB and KD being like this off ball.

37697	nba	His pick and roll and help defense have improved so much and he's been pretty decent in general this month. He has the highest defensive rating on the team this month and the team's defense goes to shit when he gets subbed out. Teams also can't attack him in pick and roll any more which is huge for our defense and will help drastically in the playoffs.

37765	politics	Scandals can be nothing burgers.  They're not exclusive.  I'm no Democrat, yet I can name at least a dozen of their positions.  Your ignorance of Republican positions is sad.  Please look at [this link](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/13/top-1-pay-nearly-half-of-federal-income-taxes.html).  The top 1% make 17% of the income, yet pay over 45% of the taxes.  So any policy that tries to even this out is easily demagogued as "cutting taxes for the rich".  But as usual, a lie makes it halfway around the world before the truth gets its shoes on.

38163	politics	That's completely ass-backwards, in this context. Two are *definitely* weaker than one. It's not a parliamentary/multi-party system, no matter how much people would like it to be.  If any one group consolidated enough power to make such a fundamental change to the entire system, the system would clearly already be working for them just fine and they'd simply move on to tackle other, more immediate issues. The problem is self-reinforcing.   So, work within the system as it's currently constituted or fantasize about third party Hail Marys. People need to pay more attention to local and state races and internal party elections, instead of just fixating on the quadrennial Presidential circus.

39552	politics	I think many of us have a pretty clear understanding of Trumps governing style by this point, and Kelly's remarks do not rebut this.   He claims Trump isn't intentionally petty, but if history has taught us anything about Trump, it's that he's intensely petty and vindictive.   His legislation prowess would suggest he's still at it, even if he and his lackeys claim otherwise.

Seems the onerous request is for you cons to demonstrate any actual voter fraud is going on beside the stuff that's been caught, namely right wingers trying to prove the voting process doesn't work by voting twice and getting caught doing it. Where's any actual evidence of this massive bussing people in to vote claim? Where's trumps 3 million illegals voting evidence?

40615	nba	I learned the hard way with Nogueira. He's the best shot-blocker on our team. For the longest time I thought blocks were a good indicator of defense and thought he was an above average defender. How wrong I was. Nogueira just does not have the defensive instincts, IQ, or switching ability to play good defense.

40632	nba	HE LITERALLY TURNS AROUND JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
40666	politics	&gt;Not sure why we keep talking about how great the economy is when nobody has any buying power,  Without debt, people have buying power. It is  this imposition of debt which was not necessary that has cut buying power and not only that, it has made it harder for OUR young people to compete with the young people of OTHER countries to start new companies.  If they could do that, it would create new jobs.  More jobs per capita are created by new, small companies that arise out of university settings than out of old  stargy companies.  And really good universities have created many new companies.  U. Wisconsin grads have recently created over 300 new companies.  And universities contribute to the GDP of the state.  Why then do Republicans demand that the US be bereft of these agents of GDP creation?  These job creators?   Because the GOP doesn't understand how job creation works.  Every ten years or so it comes up with a new failed idea of how it works - like back in the W days they talked about "the job creators..." like the head of GE who was busy offshoring jobs to India - and they never get to how innovation really happens for THIS country that benefit THIS country that add to OUR GDP.    They just plain don't know.

42128	politics	&gt;Both of these issues involve the president. The president ignores protests against him, condemns news that doesn't celebrate him or exposes his lies and says NFL protesters should be fired. He calls out people who disagree with him. The notion that he is supporting a protest elsewhere when he, as the president, is ignoring his own citizens' protests is completely hypocritical. So no, it isn't whataboutism.  Well I guess in your head that works but I don't see it as hypocritical; see next paragraph   &gt;And can you really not see the irony in Trump supposedly supporting women's rights in an Islamic country when he opposes them in his own country?   Are you really comparing Islamic rule to Trump policies? Do you even know how terribly unequal women in Iran are? And when exactly did Trump oppose women's rights?   &gt;Not to mention the numerous women he sexually assaulted? Sorry, but that's just funny. It'd be hilarious if it was not so tragic.  Allegations* much like Moore's accusers which disappeared after the election  I don't believe they're anything but accusations made for political gain.

42504	nba	Tatums shot is smooth man. 
42524	politics	&gt; The funny thing is that you are likely supporting the FBI's and deep states' attempted coup to take down Trump.  And what makes you say that? Listen, nothing is absolute. "Deep state" isn't some official club that has taken over 100% of the American government. The government is made up of the people. Trump isn't above the law, nor is he above answering to the American people. We need to get away from this "my team" is always right no matter what and everyone else is the enemy.  Different people have different motivations. I don't know Trump personally. Do I trust him more than Clinton? Probably, but the real goal is to have our system set up so we don't *need* to trust these people. That's why there is a little thing called the United States Constitution. It specifically limits power as appropriate. We just need to get back to following it.  Trump needs to let the system work. That's his biggest problem. He thinks he's somehow above everything. He's not. It's fine to not lie down and take it when people come after you, but Trump acts like he's right 100% of the time and can't ever be faulted by anyone. The man isn't a god. He's not faultless. He needs to stop being so defensive and forceful. All he's doing is ensuring he doesn't get re-elected. People are watching everything, they're paying attention to politics now, which is good. Trump needs to stay focused on his strengths and stop picking fights with every single person because when he does that he weakens his own hand. That's nothing to do with any conspiracy take down. That's Trump himself. 
42550	nba	He was said to be a talent that rivaled Lebron when he was drafted. Put it in perspective that we have a few rookies averaging 18ppg. I think many people thought he would be in the 20ppg+ ball dominant tier of players in his rookie season. 
42618	politics	Go back to Russia. 
42623	politics	I didn't say I didn't like him I'll say I didn't support him and knew he was going to lose from day one  Why I say that is because to make a serious run for President usually requires a few years of getting your name into the national news but it also requires a few years of becoming a party insider.  Working party connections and building relationships and getting support.  Clinton had been doing that for years, probably two decades..she had national name recognition, she had party support.  Sanders didn't do any of this leg work or prep work.  I wish someone else in the Democratic party had done this work but pretty much since 2008, Clinton was already the 2016 nominee.  You can say that she cheated  or that she cheated Sanders out of a fair competition but in the end, that's the political game to play if you want the nomination for your party.  Sanders damn well should've known it; I'm not a politician and I saw it.  He knew he couldn't win as an Independent but he should've known he had not done the necessary work to win as a Democrat, either   So the day he announced, I pegged his odds at somewhere between Gary Johnson and Vermin Supreme but I realistically knew that he would never win the Democratic nomination because he had no party support, he was the outsider, and he had very little if any national name recognition.  O'Malley, Chaffee and Webb were set up to make it look like a competition but nobody took them seriously either, they were the Washington Generals trotted out to play a game that everyone, including them, knew they were set up to lose.  The big tragedy about Sanders was that his fund raising effort  of individual donations allowed him to stay in the race far after he had been statistically eliminated.  Any other candidate so far behind would've lost donors but he managed to convince a lot of naive believers that he still was relevant and that he still had a chance, so they kept giving him money well beyond the point he had already lost.  So to be brutally honest, Sanders either mind-numbingy naive in not realizing he could never win or cynically selfish in taking people's money when he knew couldn't win

And those who feed, clothe and help the needy are feeding, clothing and helping him, and those that do nothing to help the needy, except when they think God is watching, are doing nothing to help Jesus and are ignoring him just as much as they ignore the needy.  To quote part of the bible: (specifically the Gospel of Matthew 25:45-46)  ‚ÄúHe will reply, ‚ÄòTruly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.‚Äô ‚ÄúThen they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.‚Äù

43629	nba	Exactly lol. They didn‚Äôt win 50 until last year with Stevens. 53 as a 1 seed I believe lol, I‚Äôm the east. Pop, Carlisle, spolstera, thibs are some that come to mind that can come up with 40 wins with that team. Pop speaks for himself. Carlisle has over achieved for years. He took a team starting Samuel Dalambert, Jose Calderon, 36 yr old Dirk and Marion, and Monta who‚Äôs out of the league to the playoffs. Carlisle also won 41 with a teams of collison, oj Mayo, 35 yr old Dirk, Chris Kaman, and Marion. Didn‚Äôt make the playoffs that season because West. Spolstera last season almost did the impossible and bud got 60 with the hawks without a superstar.

44150	politics	Same, I don't know anyone who got pissed off regarding this, and I'm glad for that.  I will tell a little story though: The only thing that pissed me off the night Bin Laden was killed was that everyone was shouting and going nuts. I was in my senior year of college, and I could hear the shouting through my concrete dorm walls. All I wanted to do was finish my thesis paper... Hard to do when the whole world around you feels like it's shouting.  My exchange student friends were also caught off guard by it, they all thought it was really scary that everyone was running around and screaming. If I was in their shoes I'd have no idea what was happening!  So that's kinda the taste that night left in my mouth- People shouting "America" and going nuts, friends getting scared, and overall a sense that while this was certainly a milestone in the war on terror, it wasn't anywhere close to the end... If an end even exists. More of a sobering night for me than anything else.

Hell, when there was talk of him T-Mac &amp; Duncan going to Orlando, a lot of people thought he'd be the best of the 3.

46756	politics	Honestly I think it‚Äôs more that people have stopped giving a shit and are building their own little universes to exist in. The Information Age has allowed us to bury our heads in the sands with false news and narratives at a scale we‚Äôve never seen.   25 years ago, my options for news were my local paper, weekly magazines, local new station, the major networks and the new cable networks such as CNN or Fox. For the most part, all of these entities were professional outlets with similar degrees of accountability and accuracy.  Today, I can get all my news from infowars, blogs, vlogs or from places on Reddit like r/conspiracy. All of which are about as credible as the man outside my friends apartment who screams at pigeons.  25 years ago, the worst someone could be was uninformed. Today it‚Äôs become misinformed. If we don‚Äôt change the way we regulate information on online platforms, this situation is only going to get worse.

48181	politics	While that's not entirely inaccurate, but the overwhelming shift to injection is largely because as long as it has the spectre of being a 'medical procedure' then its legitimacy and ethical objections become above reproach.

48318	politics	&gt; Bottom line: As we've repeatedly written ‚Äî but can't stress enough ‚Äî Trump believes this stuff to his core. Perhaps the only policy position he has consistently held for more than 30 years is that foreign countries are taking advantage of America, and that America needs to fight back. At the start of his presidency, he told President Xi that he would be gentler on trade if Xi took a harder line on North Korea's nuclear program. But in the months since, Trump has concluded that China won't play its part. So he's ready to begin the second year of his presidency with a big trade bang.

The three of you decide to split the bill three ways, but when the check comes your two friends just ask to borrow the money from you instead. Well just like them you're on a budget and can't obliged, so you tell them no and that they need to pay the amount they agreed to too.   This isn't the first time your friends did this to you either, would you just say forget it for the hundredth time or actually make them pay?   I mean your just scraping an already decided on plan to do it your way according to your logic.

51086	politics	Honestly, it's not just right wing news and entertainment sources.  Because of the bad economy colleges are not a very good investment.  You can easily spend $250,000+ on a college degree but the job market is not very good.  What we need is real, honest change to the pricing structure of colleges.      Make no mistake, education is a very very good thing so I'm not advocating people don't try and get higher education BUT many college graduates end up making the same amount as someone without a college degree because high income jobs are on the decline.  There has been a meteoric rise in the cost of schools but the benefits have been on the decline.  There are few industries where a degree is truly beneficial (mainly in the tech sector and engineering sector).  Outside of that it's hard to justify the expenses.      I don't think the government should step in and pay the bills because that just shifts the costs from the students to the taxpayers without solving the problem.  The government needs to step in and start instituting laws about what fees and costs collages can legally charge.
51104	politics	No we really fucking aren't.

He's not dumb enough to say it in public, but the bills he supports and his love of Ayn Rand says it all.

53370	politics	&gt; Americans created the election process that overwhelmingly favors rural Republicans.  Yeah, I shouldn't have gotten drunk 200 years ago and created our electoral system. That's totally my fault.  More to the point, the electoral system *didn't* favor rural candidates when it was created. That's only happened as our population has become more concentrated on urban areas. We could fix it, but - surprise! - Republicans won't stand for it.  &gt; Here on reddit you will find thousands of Americans who defend this system.  Here on Reddit you can find thousands of *anything*. And yet there are tens of millions of Americans who are upset, angry, and did not vote for Trump.  &gt; You can see that our elected representatives, literally the people who got the most votes in their home districts, *allow* Trump to ruin our country.  Correction: these representatives got the most votes in their **heavily gerrymandered** districts.   The will of the American people is not the will of the Republican party. They are hijacking our country, and to be honest I don't think anyone is sure how to fix it at this point. Most people are pinning their hopes on Mueller to ferret out the worst of the corruption. Failing that, I think the only thing left is to take to the streets, but even that would seem to have a low chance of success.

Works every time.           &gt; The Russian collusion deal is going to blow up on the Dems.         How? There has literally been nothing to indicate this. Everything has pointed to Trump and his people. The only people trying to undermine the investigation are those who are being investigated. Then Nunes actively trying to undermine it as well. That is not normal. You bash the DNC then turn your nose at blatant corruption.          &gt; the DOJ has been colluding with the FBI.         How? What proof do you have?          &gt; That's the insurance policy that's been uncovered through those text messages from the top guys.         What people can't hold private opinions and be objective? Really? That's your entire basis of an argument. Don't forget Mueller immediately fired these people when he learned of their biases. IIRC he fired these people before the leaks came out about the texts, and we only found out a while later.           &gt; It's been a year and yet there's been zero sign of any evidence.         Except Trumps son and others openly admitting too and providing direct evidence to show that they actively sought damaging information from foreign entities. ***Papadopoulos***

54722	nba	See also - John Henson, who is easily the worst defender in our starting lineup but also the best shot blocker on our team.  Shot blocking is more about length and timing than anything, but there‚Äôs a hell of a lot more to actual defence than that.

It would probably help if you first understood what the term meant.  &gt;UL is not a gold standard of private regulatory body and is more prone to bribery than government ran agencies.  The NYT article you linked to presents no evidence other than the fact that accidents happen. This is the key sentence in that piece:  &gt;&gt;Underwriters officials reject such characterizations and say that industry's input is needed to determine if proposed U.L. changes are doable at a reasonable cost. **"It would be very easy for us to come up with an overly strict standard," but then the product could be so costly that no one could buy it,** Mr. Drengenberg said.   For the typical dumbfuck progressive nothing is ever safe enough, and even one accident is "evidence" that UL is taking bribes.

The electoral college is precisely why third-party votes are seen as wasted.  The candidate who wins the state wins all of the votes.  Did you vote for Jill Stein in Michigan?  Nope, the EC erased your vote, you actually voted for Trump.  Did you vote for Gary Johnson in California?  Nope the EC erased your vote, you actually voted for Clinton.  Your vote goes to whoever the winner of your state is, regardless of whether you actually hit the button with their name.   &gt;And it's crucial we keep our Constitution in tact.  Bullshit.  The founding fathers very specifically knew it would have to be changed as time goes on, that why they allowed for it to be amended.     &gt;The mob should never rule.  It does for 99.999% of all elected offices in this country, stop jerking yourself off with "muh tyranny of the majority".

58156	politics	I was arguing that the labeled milligram content wasn't accurate. Your argument requires every single edible to be tested and correctly labeled to the THC percent.  My point was that the THC levels aren't being labeled but the content of what is being put into it. If they use dope concentrate over shitty flower it will be more potent, like Korova does.  Ignoring the MG content because it's not something universal.  For instance, a Bhang bar around the corner from my house at 100mg isn't as potent as the Korova at the same 100mg dosage. Because the product they use is different, my argument isn't about what constitutes THC but what constitutes potency.  THC alone doesn't define that and as shown the labeling isn't always accurate so you can't think that 10mg is the same as 10mg somewhere else.  My point about using concentrates vs flower was the source of the product prior to it becoming concentrate, not that there is two different types of THC levels.     Just that you can't trust something just because it says its 100mg's of THC or whatever in CA right now because no one is being forced to test their shit.  We know that THC alone doesn't define the potency

58597	politics	I still fail to understand how the GOP gets a free pass on this shitshow of an administration when I see a few times a week that Hillary and the Democrats are responsible. Both parties are hide bound and stuck in their bubbles, but the party that won has to be credited with the fruits of their labours. The 'day old fish' aura that you decry is the result a long time in the political process, much of which was spent being the target of multiple probes, enquiries and hearings. She was smeared by all of these investigations, but never charged. No one is perfect, especially when the Republican propaganda machine gets its fangs into you. 
58647	nba	bruno gets to the rim at will so it doesn‚Äôt matter
58757	politics	&gt; We see a deeply flawed candidate who was deep into the pockets of corporate interest and had no apparent issue with trading political favors for campaign contributions. If we can't come to some reconciliation here, I fear we are going to come to the same impasse.  And we don't have to agree on that. We have a primary to see how many people have your view and how many people have our view. Then we put aside our differences for the good of the country. That's how it works.   &gt;This country needs to be pushed as far in a progressive direction as possible. Even if your views are centrist, the only way we are going to restore order is by dragging American politics as far left as possible. They have shifted so far right that desperate correction is necessary.  That's...not how it works. Nominating a far left candidate doesn't magically make it easier to pass change in Congress. This is the main problem I have with people who attack Clinton. You all seem to think the only thing that matters is the President. It really isn't. The reality is that Bernie and Hillary would have had very similar presidencies because real change has to go through Congress first, and Congress is stacked against change. It's literally been true since the Constitution was first written. Change is a long hard slog that must go through the road of incremental progress. This notion that we can just radically shift the conversation and that will magically make change easier is so wrong that it's troubling that are so many people who think this way. At best, it will lead to a bunch of idealists who think change is around the corner and become disappointed to find out that Bernie can't fix Congress.  &gt;So even if you believe progressivism is misguided, we all need to get on board with it so that we can tug the national consciousness towards framing our political issues in a much more reasonable context. It's very worrying when I see a name like Joe Biden floated as the Dem candidate for president in 2020. That tells me that nothing is being learned.  No. We all need to voice our ideas and let the ideas do the talking in the primary. Then we need to come together and work as one in the general. There's not enough sane, rational people in this country that we can afford to splinter. Bernie will go into 2020 as the favorite. If he can't win, there are no more excuses to be made.   And as much as I don't like him, if he does win, I'll do my part to convince all the other people who don't like him to do the right thing for the good of the country. But progressives damn-well better do the same if he doesn't win. I don't want to hear any more bullshit about how they have to sit out the election to punish the DNC.

So when I see the heresy coming from people like Trump who think they‚Äôre somehow higher than Governmentit makes me feel ill.  I imagine this is what it must feel like to be a devoted Christian and have atheists attack one‚Äôs belief system.  It causes so much stress, how can I defend Government from these American crusaders?

Do you have anything showing she lives a healthy lifestyle?

He says that Mueller collusion investigation is dead because he didn‚Äôt charge Flynn and Pampa with collusion related charges, completely ignoring the fact that they are both witnesses cooperating *against their boss* who most likely know about or even directed them to do what they did. He plainly says Mueller has no evidence right after talking about how two of Trump‚Äôs people were caught colluding. He acts like we are aware of everything Mueller has found and he decides that‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs an opinion piece on an exclusively conservative blog site with no reporting credibility, I can see why you picked it

How the fuck does that not alarm you? That‚Äôs flat out ridiculous and a danger to our democracy. At that point, it‚Äôs nothing but people who are butthurt that Trump won and doing everything they can to delegitimize his presidency, and sow doubt and chaos into our democracy by continually slandering the president.   It‚Äôs clear that if Mueller exonerates Trump, that a large segment of the anti-trump population wouldn‚Äôt stop and would just come up with new accusations and excuses as to why Trump should be kicked out of office. That‚Äôs literally opposing our democracy lol he‚Äôs the fucking democratically elected president of our republic. Accept it. Especially if Mueller exonerates him, like what the fuck is the problem?
61835	nba	If you‚Äôre a righty and prefer to jump off one foot (my personal preference) approach the rim from the left side of the court behind the ark. Opposite if you‚Äôre a lefty. Then just one dribble and 2 steps and you can throw it down with your momentum carrying you forward not needing to account for hanging on the rim or anything.  Other option is 2 foot. If you see great 2 foot dunkers they‚Äôll take a bunch of quick little steps before leaping forward with the leg opposite the one the hand they wanna dunk with before gathering with the other to convert the forward momentum up.

China is poised to be the power of the 21st Century, as America was of the 20th.  Meanwhile we are languishing with infrastructure that hasn't been updated since The New Deal and our withdrawal from TPP just gave China the fastest developing region in the world.  Highways in Africa ensure they will also control the final frontier of developing nations, leaving the US with only South America, in shambles from decades of meddling on behalf of fruit companies, devolving more every year.  Kids in school need to forgo Spanish or French(ha!) In favor of Mandarin or Cantanese if they want a chance at the future.

65670	politics	I compared Amtrak to Bus, Plane, private car (gas, lodging for a cross country trip) and Amtrak is ridiculously expensive, inconvenient and time consuming.  Most people travel by train because they fear flying or are longing for adventure/nostalgia.  Trying to unravel what President is thinking is futile. He's completely out of touch with reality and has surrounded himself with sycophants and familial parasites.  Amtrak is not "infrastructure", it uses existing tracks, which are already being heavily utilized for bulk transport.  President Trump has no business in the oval office. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton belongs in prison.

66030	politics	Good talk! 
66032	politics	Yea, but we taught that sand a lesson. 
66036	politics	&gt; the problem is that throwing more money at problems doesn't always fix them.    This wouldn't be "throwing money at." This would be adequate funding of so that states pay for operating expenses - so that debt of the student isn't created by lack of scholarships and by rising tuition.  Tuition like every other cost does go up though some state public universities have imposed a lid on it. And state universities are far more efficient than private ones in general.   Both the battle over state funding of public universities and the battle for scholarships has raged since Grover Norquist and the future of the US has lost - for the past 17 years.   But.... it doesn't have to.  There is no economic reason why the US has to be deprived of a future while MOST OTHER COUNTRIES have one.   Why should we "lose?"  When we know how to "win?"   Let me go over it one more time. 1950s, 60s, 70s: We had adequate funding and we won.  We won the economic race. We won the space race.   Rich people were not hurt by winning.  They were hurt by 1929 and they were hurt by 2006-2008, just as the average American was also hurt.  It is in the best interest of all, the rich, the poor, the student, the graduate to fund American colleges so that American graduates can compete with foreign graduates.   Otherwise: foreign graduates will start new companies and Americans won't.  And there won't be any new jobs.  That's the problem we're up against - Republicans have no undertanding of how this all works and have apparently no "memory of" or ability to study the years from say 1959 until 1980 when ww won all these races.  We had a great economy.  They WANT no memory of it and they take advantage of young people who weren't around then and don't know that things can be better.

68273	nba	1 is definitely a good prediction, but there were a bunch of people who thought that Lebron might go back home in 2014. From there, a ring isn't a huge stretch. Number 2 is just a running joke, the Spirs have been an elite team that everyone ignores for 20 years now. Kawhi was really good in the 2013 finals, and I don't know quite when this thread was made, but if it was later, this wasn't an amazing stretch. 4 was a good prediction, I'll admit. Kyrie is not on AI's level (I know, Cavs flair=bias) but I think he needs an MVP to get on that level. Bynum had aleready started to decline by then.

68490	politics	It's a lockdown.  Thanks OP taking one for the team.
68505	politics	&gt;Absolutely, some Republicans are corrupt. Remember, President Trump was a hostile takeover of the GOP. The GOP is not on the side of President Trump. Nunes supports Trump, not the GOP establishment. And because you seem to think I'm a Republican, I'm not. I'm Left of Center and voted for Obama twice and Trump.  I don't give a shit where you stand on the spectrum or who you claim to have voted for. The point is, you point at the left, when the Republicans run the government and the investigation. It's cognitive dissonance at its worst.  &gt;Obviously, technically Mueller can't impeach Trump. That has to happen through Congress. He can get the information to allow Congress to impeach Trump, though, and that seems to have been the plan, only it didn't work out.  Whose plan? The left's? See above..  &gt;You can cling to this all you want.  Cling to what? Literal public knowledge?  &gt;After over a year of investigation, I'm convinced Mueller has nothing on Trump. If he brings new information forward, I'll reconsider,  New information has come out every couple of weeks. Every new revelation brings us a rung higher in the Trump food chain. Does it go all the way to the top? I dunno, my mind is set on a set of possibilities, not a single conclusion. It is very possible that the top rungs of Trump's campaign were dirty and not the candidate himself. That you cannot even entertain this possibility at this point tells me you are lying to yourself about reconsidering, not matter what comes to light.   &gt;given the corrupt nature of the investigation thus far  Nothing about this probe is corrupt. You believe that it is for absolutely no reason - at least none presented so far.  &gt;the lengthy time period it has taken up  Oh. This talking point bullshit. Where is the magical finish line for you? Six months? A couple days? Two guilty pleas by cooperating witnesses means nothing to you in this timeline?  &gt;I personally think Mueller trumped up charges to save face.  This is plain stupid. Mueller left a high-paying job to take on this role. He does not have to save face. He could have ended the probe within weeks if he'd have found nothing - and gone back to his cushy partner spot at the swanky law firm. And, of course, this ignores the cooperating witnesses (known because of plea deals) and everything else, but it's just stupid.  &gt;He didn't want to come up empty handed after over a year of investigating, but what he went looking for wasn't there.  So, serious question: Why do you lie? Why are you lying about the timeline? Mueller was hired in May. Of 2017. He has not been working on the probe "for over a year" - we're just over the half-year mark *now.* Is part of your lie that he is covering for the egos of all the other FBI agents who started over a year ago? Or do you think you can just blithely lie about the facts and not be called out for it?  &gt;...after they tainted the investigation.  lol.. causation is hard  &gt;lol  No, really. It's fucking stupid. You try so hard to make it about "the Left," when Republicans are literally running every single Russia probe. All three of them are run by Republicans.  &gt;Who is connected to a bunch of the people in the FBI. It's almost like the GOP establishment doesn't like Trump. Who would've thunk it...  Nice goalposts you got there. It would be a shame if someone were to plant them in place so you couldn't move them when convenient.  &gt;Oh, the Left didn't support Mueller?  lol jesus

69131	politics	Sure, I would too. The thing to realize though is with those people, you're never going to get it. Either they can find a way to disingenuously twist what you say against you, or they can't. There's no alternative possibility with certain types of people.  That doesn't make engagement a waste of time. The trolls and the genuinely delusional brainwashed people don't matter, but the lurkers who don't vote or comment at all but still read do. Rule of thumb here is 10/3/1. So for every 10 people reading comments only 3 of them vote and only 1 of them comments. So even if you never get a reaction at all, there's still potentially 7 people who you might be reaching. Engage for them, to give them something to think about. And when even trolls can't think of a response, it means you've probably made a good impression on the lurkers.

69651	politics	I would see your decriminalization and raise you full legalization with taxation. The world wasn't coming to an end with heroin, cocaine, and laudanum back in the 1900's. Prohibitionists got a hold of the "dope fiend" hobby-horse, the same as with alcohol, and here we are. A junkie in those days was not the desperate character he is portrayed as now. Pot in 1936 was just a way for Harry Anslinger to expand the Beareau of Narcotics to take over for the lost revenue and power caused by the repeal of the Volstead Act. Racist xenophobia has been at the core of any drug prohibition since the Smoking Opium bans of San Francisco. What were those Chinese migrants doing? Raping white women? No, they were trying to relax after a hard 14 hour day of laying railroad track for slave wages; it was just a "foreign" vice, and therefore evil. I posit that if we are going to go back to Gilded Age economically, we may as well get the Laudanum back.

70693	politics	College degrees have become (closer to) meaningless with the growth of our non-merit based society. People are promoted and hired based on their networking skills and social ability rather than qualifications rooted in degree level.   A couple decades ago when this trend began, it made sense: Lots of capable diamonds in the rough exist who don't have advanced degrees. However, it's now gotten to the point where it's causing significant damage across a wide range of industries as well as our higher education (especially graduate-level) system.

71269	politics	&gt; that Trump wants to put illegal immigrants in camps. Guess what, Democrats have been doing exactly that, it's called jail.  Actually that's three strike laws, and for profit prisons which are primary to the GOP. Look at Sessions and his push for expanding private for profit prisons. Arizona and other red boarder states to the south have laws that directly target immigrants to put them in jail, and laws to keep them there. ***For profit prisons***. That's not a democrat deal. The tax plan of the GOP benefits for profit prisons and they are a huge lobby group for the GOP, and yes dems, but it's the GOP writing this shit and passing this shit. That's not a democratic deal. Democrats have generally been on the push to move away from them and we have laws like I said, that directly target minority groups (and immigrants) to keep them in jail because money.          &gt; regarding the Russia deal.

They are useless to me. We're talking close to a half million people in my company.   I think the better question here is, why are you putting false information out?

You were wrong about that, but instead of just admitting it, you're trying to have me change my status at work for 10 years because .... just admit you were wrong.
71419	politics	Not *your* fault but the fault of Americans as a group.  I bet you big money that if we asked Americans whether they wanted the election system of the US Constitution or some different system then Americans would overwhelmingly vote for the same old system. "Constitution, 'Murica, Freedom!"  How many Americans today do you think would vote to scrap the Senate? Show me the hundred million people who demand an unpartisan commission to decide voting districts. How many Americans can even understand proportional voting? And who gerrymandered those districts? The same people who Americans voted in last election and whom they will vote for again.  Your argument is akin to the "No True Scotsman" fallacy. Americans are responsible for their government: paying taxes and voting, not standing up for their community, are without a doubt forms of consent.

Thats obviously illegal...* and then you live through it and go "OH. I see."  You look around you and see it happening, and everyone seemingly petrified in place, and realise when you're in the events there is just an ongoing dumpster fire that no-one has any idea how to stop. This could easily continue going downhill fast, and no-one can find the brakes.

71866	politics	We did.  Check my post history I've talked about it in my last ten comments.  Not at length, mostly on posts like this one.  Youre 100% correct.  He was voted on and elected.  I am a member and we nominated a Democrat to run against him and the committee voted 62-12 for the Republican.  No speeches were allowed even though the Chairman and our candidate (and I) met a few days before and discussed compromises, one of which being that they would both speak before with our candidate going first so that the winner (who was always likely to win) could agree to those changes before the vote, making progressives feel better about him and our party.  Instead - the whip shut down the motion without a vote (against bylaws) and the vote was held, the leadership adjourned the meeting and only THEN did the "candidates" speak.  The winner went first and was given respect though he did not show it.  he agreed to change the bylaws (during our meeting, not in his speech) so that endorsements of all candidates come only after a vote by the committee and then in his speech specifically mentioned working hard for the "Van Drew Campaign" (the most conservative Dem in NJ legislature) when we specifically explained that we reject the county's endorsement of him without a vote - we have a progressive candidate and the primary isn't until June.   Van Drew is already touting an endorsement by all County Committees in the district, this was on his campaign page the day he announced.  THEN our candidate got to speak and the leadership of the committee interrupted him three times and finally drowned him out.  It was disgraceful.     The reason he is our chairman is because he donated about 30k to local races in 2017 and 5k to the state dem committee.  Van Drew is hand picked by Rep Norcross and Norcross sees this county growing and wants influence - he wants to be seen as somewhat responsible for the blue wave that's coming here naturally so he can have influence when our county has influence at the state.  Van Drew got the former Chairman nominated to be County Prosecutor.  It's all blatant and open political favors, even if our former Chairman will make an awesome Prosecutor, the rest still matters as does the process.

From what I've seen of the Saudis, they don't hype the event, often meting out punishment upon a thoroughfare on the outskirts of the city with just a few witnesses. Myself? I'm of the "there but for the grace of fate go I" philosophy. I feel kind of bad for people that fuck up so badly with their lives that they end up with 'life' or 'death row.' Not nearly as badly as I feel for victims of their crimes, mind you; but I'm thankful for the brain I've got and hopeful that it doesn't betray me my whole life.

72833	politics	&gt; In any event, the notion that other states ‚Äúsubsidize‚Äù big blue states through the SALT deduction happens to be wrong. As New York State Comptroller Thomas P. DiNapoli demonstrated in a 2016 study, the ‚Äúsubsidy‚Äù generally goes in the other direction: The states with the largest state and local tax burdens typically paid out more to the federal coffers than they received in return. The states with the biggest outflow were those on the West Coast and Northeast, and those receiving the largest inflows tended to be Southern states with low state and local taxes.      https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7n8b9i/killing_the_state_and_local_tax_deduction_may_be/

78102	politics	&gt;Self-driving trucks will be the first to hit the market.  Do you know anything at all about driving a tractor trailer? Do you know anything at all about mechanical engineering? Do you know anything at all about current logistics and company positioning?  Tractors and trailers are huge investments for companies. Tractors depending on the company are replaced every so often and sold on the secondary market. The trailers however are only retired if they are in absolutely terrible shape. Replacing all of them would be a huge unneeded investment.   Now with that said... driving at truck is quite a bit more challenging and they will be at least a decade or more behind vehicles from being fully autonomous.   The current infrastructure is built up around a tractor that hooks to a trailer in a very specific way. Mainly a kingpin(that will likely not change) a pigtail, and 2 air lines. Those can change but it would be a difficult task. I could get into all the nuances but I don't want this to be that long of a reply. Some bullet points though... dropping a trailer and hooking one up will need a driver for the foreseeable future. Driving outside of the highways will need a driver. The way the current infrastructure is set up a truck driver needs to break and or skirt a few laws here and there to do their job. Or at least do so in a timely manner.   Will it happen eventually? Sure but the earliest I can see it is 2 to 3 decades away before market penetration is anywhere near 50%. That or we have a huge leap in AI and robotics.   What I do see happening with trucks is more driver aids. Allowing the truck to drive on its own without any driver intervention, but a timer and or a countdown on when it's estimated the driver will need to be back in the seat when an exit is coming up.   Now as for a college degree? I agree they are useful, just not for everyone. Also... jobs that tend to take degrees are actually more easily automated than something that requires manual labor. An accountant for instance will be automated long before a truck driver will.

78274	politics	My point is I don‚Äôt think that the court rules on whether senatorial procedural rules were followed. Those are virtually entirely at the discretion of the senate. So if after a revenue raising provision is stripped, the fact that the existing portions are no longer within the revenue changes required for the procedure of passage is not relevant. Those are senate rules, which don‚Äôt get retroactively evaluated if scotus removes part of a bill.   I‚Äôm not a constitutional lawyer, but that‚Äôs because senatorial parliamentary procedures are not governed by scotus. So once it‚Äôs been signed by the President, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the courts have removed a source of revenue.   Of course, it‚Äôs conceivable they could consider that a vital part of the law, which they could decide makes the entirety of the law require it be rewritten. But I don‚Äôt see the court stepping on congresses authority in that way, especially this court.   Lastly, the rules of procedure are about cutting off debate and heading to a vote. Not whether the bill can be voted on. No bills (short of overcoming a veto or something special) requires 60 votes. 60 votes are simply required for cloture, meaning the ending of debate. The vote itself always comes down to 51 votes. Laws used to often be passed with 60+ cloture votes but then just 51-59 votes for passage. They are two different votes and the cloture vote isn‚Äôt the vote to send it to the president.   TLDR: passage never requires 60 votes. Only cloture. Reconciliation is simply a process where cloture can occur with 51 votes.  All bills take just 51 votes, whether the ACA or reconciliation bills.

83434	nba	I was at this game.. Pacers absolutely looked lost without GOATipo, I honestly don't see them ending their slump until he comes back
83475	nba	&gt; but his block count is weak af.  because he doesn't want to risk fouling a dude, putting himself in foul trouble just to get 1-2 more blocks per game. And Dr. J was one of the greatest shot blockers in the history of professional basketball.    If you compare Lebron's playoff totals (when he ramps up his defense and blocks in paticular), [you'd see he currently sit just a little behind Dr. J for total blocks.](http://www.landofbasketball.com/all_time_leaders/blocks_total_career_playoffs.htm).  Dr. J has 239 blocks in 11 seasons (11th) vs 209 in 12 seasons (12th).     Granted Dr. J did his in significantly less games than Lebron, but Dr. J has the highest blocks for a non-big (i.e. PF or C).  In fact the only non-big on the top 25 in the playoffs are Dr. J (11th), Lebron (21st), Pippen (23rd), Wade (24th).    So using a metric to compares him *only* to the greatest non-big to do something isn't a good barometer to how good someone is.    That's like looking at a guys 100 meter time and then only comparing him to Usain Bolt and saying "his time is weak af" ... "compared to Bolt" (something you said in two different quotes).

85034	politics	More like you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm saying in my comment.  The high tax states don‚Äôt need to rely on the federal government as heavily, because they tax their citizens more.  They invest in infrastructure necessary to support a high functioning economy.  They pay a high % of money going to the federal coffers and subsidize other lower tax states requiring more federal aid.

On the bright side, your friend is now a permanent resident and to my knowledge, is guaranteed to be able to come back to the US with little difficulty.  Also to your comment on DACA recipients being entitled from an r/DACA thread:  Their parents aren't out their protesting.  They are too busy working their shit jobs and not making a sound because they know how lucky they are to just be in the US as illegals.  DACA recipients didn't get their sense of entitlement from their families.  It's an American sense of entitlement.  They are Americans in essentially every single way (including in their sense of entitlement).
87446	nba	Yeah, the number of post up possessions he gets is way down this season. He's definitely playing out on the perimeter a lot more. It usually isn't as bad as the Bucks game though where he attempted 8 threes out of his 12 FGA.

Every team that they would want to trade for to get it's star player will go "okay give us your brooklyn pick" cavs would say no and the other team would go "okay fuck off then", like it isn't that easy

90072	nba	Our bench pieces are fine I think. Dieng and Bjelly are borderline starter material for a mediocre team, Tyus is good enough start, Crawfords a bit old but still a decent bench player. Shabazz is probably the only one who's not worthy of starting anywhere.  I'd argue our bench blows leads because they don't mesh well from not playing together enough.

91015	politics	&gt;you can do it without taking on $100k of debt.   Jerry Brown has not been the best friend of public higher education. The Cal State system costs less (than the $10K),  But the UC system costs more.  Can someone get a great education in the Cal State system?  Sure.  However several of the UCs are in the top 100 universities in the world.    Jerry Brown often laments that when he went to college UC tuition was only $50.  Well great.  When he want to college, the state covered 16 times the cost of tuition.  Now it covers less than 30% so that the funding of universities since when Jerry Brown went to college has dropped by a factor of over 40.  But go ask Jerry about supporting the UC and Cal State systems more.  And now? Heading into double taxation?

Trump believes he's entitled to live like a king after losing the popular vote to win the presidency. The Republicans will see this as exactly the dog whistle they need to mimic his actions. Never admit fault. Build bigger walls. People and Americans specifically are the enemy at all times.  Standard Republican fear tactics working.

93165	politics	Just because a company isn't extracting every penny in profit doesn't mean they're not viable.  Amazon reinvests every penny and it's allowed them to dominate the market.  They used would be profits to fund a throwaway experiment called AWS, which turned into their greatest money maker.  WalMart and Apple used to do the same, resulting in rapid domination of any market they entered.  Both became stagnant once they shifted to maximizing returns.    How much money does one guy even need?  Musk could've remained a boutique, budget supercar maker and seen good profits.  Instead he reinvests in pushing the envelope and like all risks sometimes you win and sometimes you don't.  He built the first, and only viable, space agency from the ground up which by itself would be a monumental legacy.  America was built by visionaries and he's one of the last of a dying breed.  Now, we measure contribution to society by how much wealth you control at the time of your passing, which does nothing for anyone but their children.

94032	politics	Thank you for a well-written and well-thought-out response.  While I admit to posting plenty of snark and sarcastic comments myself, deep down inside I actually value the serious comments (when I'm reading through a comment thread, I first skim over the short one or two line comments and seek out the longer replies to read first, for example).  So, thank you for your reply.      I have found myself holding back on posting commentary that might go against the popular opinion on r/politics, because whenever I have done so it immediately gets downvoted into oblivion.  (I lean on the liberal side, but I do have some conservative views as well).  While I don't really care much about the karma points, it does mean the comment itself gets shoved to the bottom, hidden and therefore might as well never been posted in the first place.      Sorry to get all meta and all that, but like you said, this is as good as a place as any.  r/politics really has become very insular, with the same small set of posters contributing a large portion of the articles, and all of the articles falling within a limited range of topics from a limited range of source (by necessity due to the whitelist, admittedly).  If I wanted to, I could put in certain search terms into google news, pull down five articles to post to r/politics each day, and reap the karmic rewards.  It's pretty formulaic.  And the comment strings are equally as predictable and formulaic.    It seems r/politics has turned into more of a circlejerk than a serious place to learn about politics.  There's something broken about it, that has resulted in this situation where r/politics is turning into a parody of its own self (I'm sure there's a word for that).  And I have no idea of a solution, either.  I guess I'm just griping for now, sorry.  And a great way to close out the year, as well. :(  Hoping to see a better reddit in 2018.       Edit: And speaking of the alt accounts, You mentioned the St. Petersburg crew, but I think we also need to keep an eye out for the domestic equivalents.  Over the next several months we are going to see a major social media push (fueled by the money of certain very rich political donors) that will be feeding this, as they do a big push to make the tax scam popular.
